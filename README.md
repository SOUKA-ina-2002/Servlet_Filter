# Servlet_Filter
This repository contains a simple Java web application showcasing the usage of servlets and filters. The application consists of two main components:

Servlet: A basic servlet (AppServlet) that demonstrates how to handle HTTP requests and generate dynamic HTML content.

Filter: A filter (SecurityFilter) implemented to perform request filtering based on a predefined condition. This filter intercepts incoming requests, checks for a specific user parameter, and restricts access if the condition is met.
